  ** applying Dependency Inversion principle (DI) by implemnting Dependency Injection technique.
    
3. applying and practising core OOP principles:
  ** using inheritance, virtualization, abstraction to achieve polymorphism and increase re-usability and eliminate redundancy
  ** using interfaces to develop againest abstraction instead of concrete types
   
5. implementing Template Method design pattern to reduce redundancy in hierarchial classes
  
6. applying general clean code practices such as:
    ** writing small well-structured functions
